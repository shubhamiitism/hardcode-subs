[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   [music]
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   And I'll learn to get along and throw your back from outer space.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   I just walked in and found you here with that said look upon your face.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   I should have changed that stupid lock.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   I should have made you leave your key.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   If I had no for just one second you'd be back to bottom here, go on now, go.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Walk out the door.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Frank!
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Bring your head in this window while I roll it up in there.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Got it.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   [music]
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Frank!
